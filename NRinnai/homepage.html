				 <center><h1>Appliance Troubleshooting Checklist</h1><center>

                 <p>If your INFINITY Water heater is not working properly, please check the following points:


                 If Rinnai INFINITY water heater controller(s) are installed on the wall in a kitchen or bathroom, are they turned on? Please note that you will need to turn controllers back on after a power cut.
                 Is there power at the appliances power point? For the INFINITY, the switch is often located outside. Tip: Plug in a phone charger or similar to check if the power point is working.
                 Is there a fuse that has been tripped relating to the appliance? If the fuse or circuit breaker (RCD) has tripped this may be indicative of an electrical fault, as generally fuses or RCDs do not trip out without cause. We advise replacing the fuse or resetting the RCD.  If the circuit trips again an electrician or other qualified person needs to be called.
                 Is there gas in the LPG cylinder?
                 Is the LPG cylinder valve open?
                 If the LPG cylinder has just been replaced or if the INFINITY has not been used for some time, you may need to bleed air out of the gas line.  Go to a mixer tap in the house and turn it to the full hot position. Then turn the tap handle on and off 10 times.  Check if hot water is being produced. If not, repeat for a further 10 times and then check.
                 The size of the LPG cylinder needs to be 45kg for the INFINITY to operate properly. Smaller cylinders will “freeze up” in cold weather.</p>

                 <p>[+] How does Rinnai calculate their claim of typical hot water heating savings of to up to 10%?


                 [+] Is it possible to supply the cylinder with LED control pad locatable away from the cylinder?


                 [+] Will you be developing an APP that will enable remote access to change the setting?


                 [+] What if more hot water is required, i.e. additional people coming to stay?


                 [+] How long does it take to learn a new pattern?


                 [+] What is the warranty on the Rinnai Smart Cylinder™?


                 [+] We would love to be able to put a Smart controller on it’s own to attach to an existing cylinder?


                 [+] How does the Rinnai Smart Cylinder™ reduce the risk of legionella?</p>
